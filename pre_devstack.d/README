stack.sh from midonet_stack.sh

The executable files in this directory get executed 
in the order in which bash sorts with the current locale(set
to C and exported in midonet_stack.sh)

File name convention:

The script filename must look like 
NNN.descriptive_explanation_of_the_file.EXT,

where NNN is 3 digit number and EXT is filename
extention.
